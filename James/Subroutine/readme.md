# Introduction to subroutines 
Sometimes when writing code there may be some alogrithms or sequences that repeat themselves in other to
avoid retyping those algorithms programmers use this thing we call subroutines otherwise know as functions.
This helps the code to be more easy to read quicker to type and neater etc. Here is how you define a function in 
python 

```python

def my_sub():
  pass

```
