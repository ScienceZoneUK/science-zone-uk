## üïπÔ∏è **Game Description**

A single raindrop falls from the top of the Micro:bit screen.
The player moves a ‚Äúbucket‚Äù at the bottom by tilting the Micro:bit left or right.
Catch the raindrop to score a point ‚Äî if you miss, you lose one!

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Lesson Flow (Teacher Guide)**

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Introduction (10 mins)**

üí¨ Ask students:

* What happens when it rains?
* How would you ‚Äúcatch‚Äù a drop using the Micro:bit?
* How can we tell when something has been caught?

üìå Explain:
The **Micro:bit‚Äôs accelerometer** can sense tilt ‚Äî left, right, or flat ‚Äî so we can use it to move our bucket.
We‚Äôll use the LEDs as our screen.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **The Problem: Catch the Drop! (5 mins)**

Challenge:

> Build a game where a **raindrop falls from the top**, and the **player tilts** the Micro:bit to move a bucket at the bottom to **catch it** before it hits the ground.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Step-by-Step Coding Guide**

---

‚úÖ **Step 1: Import Libraries**

```python
from microbit import *
import random
```

We need `microbit` for LED and tilt controls, and `random` for drop positions.

---

‚úÖ **Step 2: Set Up Game Variables**

```python
drop_x = random.randint(0, 4)
drop_y = 0
bucket_x = 2
score = 0
```

* `drop_x`, `drop_y` ‚Üí position of the falling drop
* `bucket_x` ‚Üí where the player‚Äôs bucket sits
* `score` ‚Üí player‚Äôs current score

---

‚úÖ **Step 3: Game Loop**

```python
while True:
    display.clear()
```

We‚Äôll continuously redraw the screen so it updates as the drop falls.

---

‚úÖ **Step 4: Read Tilt Movement**

```python
    x = accelerometer.get_x()

    if x < -200 and bucket_x > 0:
        bucket_x -= 1
    elif x > 200 and bucket_x < 4:
        bucket_x += 1
```

üëâ Tilting left or right moves the bucket.
We also keep it within the screen edges (0‚Äì4).

---

‚úÖ **Step 5: Move the Drop**

```python
    drop_y += 1
```

Each loop makes the raindrop fall one row lower.

---

‚úÖ **Step 6: Check for Catch or Miss**

```python
    if drop_y == 4:
        if drop_x == bucket_x:
            score += 1
            display.show(Image.HAPPY)
        else:
            score -= 1
            display.show(Image.SAD)
        sleep(500)
        drop_x = random.randint(0, 4)
        drop_y = 0
```

When the drop reaches the bottom row:

* If it lands on the same x-position as the bucket ‚Üí **catch it!**
* Otherwise ‚Üí **miss!**

---

‚úÖ **Step 7: Draw Drop and Bucket**

```python
    display.set_pixel(drop_x, drop_y, 9)
    display.set_pixel(bucket_x, 4, 5)
    sleep(500)
```

This shows both the falling drop and the player‚Äôs bucket at the same time.

---

‚úÖ **Step 8: Full Code**

```python
from microbit import *
import random

drop_x = random.randint(0, 4)
drop_y = 0
bucket_x = 2
score = 0

while True:
    display.clear()

    # Move bucket using tilt
    x = accelerometer.get_x()
    if x < -200 and bucket_x > 0:
        bucket_x -= 1
    elif x > 200 and bucket_x < 4:
        bucket_x += 1

    # Move drop down
    drop_y += 1

    # Check if drop reaches the bottom
    if drop_y == 4:
        if drop_x == bucket_x:
            score += 1
            display.show(Image.HAPPY)
        else:
            score -= 1
            display.show(Image.SAD)
        sleep(500)
        drop_x = random.randint(0, 4)
        drop_y = 0

    # Draw drop and bucket
    display.set_pixel(drop_x, drop_y, 9)
    display.set_pixel(bucket_x, 4, 5)
    sleep(500)
```

### üß† **Discussion & Reflection**

üí¨ Ask pupils:

* How does tilt affect the bucket‚Äôs movement?
* How can we make the game more challenging?
* What happens if we make the drop fall faster?

---

### üöÄ **Extension Ideas**

* Increase drop speed as score increases.
* Display the score after 10 drops.
* Add sound effects when catching or missing.
* Add a ‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù animation when the score drops below 0.
* Use different LED brightness for water splash effects.

---

### ‚úÖ **Wrap-Up**

By the end of the session, students can:

* Use accelerometer inputs to control movement.
* Use variables to track position and score.
* Create a working **Catch the Drop** game with feedback and logic.
