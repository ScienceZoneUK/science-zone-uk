#   Micro-Bit Workshop : Treasure Hunt 🏴‍☠️

# 👋 Welcome!
Ahoy, young coder! Ready to turn your Micro:bit into a real-life treasure detector?

In this workshop, you'll create your very own Treasure Hunt game using MicroPython and two Micro:bits. You’ll use radio signals, compass directions, and some clever coding to help players track down hidden treasure. It’s exciting, a bit mysterious, and seriously rewarding when it all comes together!

# 🧠 Objectives

- You will be able to recall key MicroPython functions such as `display.scroll()`, `radio.send()`, and `compass.heading()`.
- You will be able to explain how radio signals and compass readings are used to detect proximity in the treasure hunt game.
- You will be able to write MicroPython code that uses the radio and compass to guide users in the game.
- You will be able to compare signal strength values and analyse how these affect LED brightness on the receiver.
- You will be able to assess the effectiveness of their radar design and suggest ways to improve feedback to the user.
- You will be able to develop a fully working treasure hunt game using two micro:bits and MicroPython code.

# 🗺️ Why Treasure Hunt?
Treasure Hunt is a great game to build because:

It’s simple just two Micro:bits and a bit of Python magic.

It teaches you how radio signals and compass readings work.

You’ll see your code come alive as the Micro:bit becomes a real tracker!

It’s super fun and you can customise it with sounds, lights, or challenges!

# 💻 Get Set Up

# Coding Activity

## 🧩 Setting up the Micro bits
This project will require two microbits a transmitter and a reciever 
## 1 Transmitter
```
from microbit import *
import radio
radio.config(group=1, power=1)
radio.on()

while True:
    radio.send('1')
    sleep(200)
```

## 🧠 Code Breakdown – Line by Line

`from microbit import *`
👉 This brings in everything your micro:bit needs to work:
like `display`, `sleep()`, and `buttons`.

`import radio`
📡 This brings in the radio tools, so your micro:bit can send and receive messages wirelessly.

`radio.config(group=1, power=1)`
🛠 This sets up the radio system:

`group=1`
→ Think of this like a walkie-talkie channel.
Only micro:bits using the same group number can talk to each other.

`power=1`
→ This controls how far the signal goes.
`1` = short range (about 1 meter), `7 `= long range (up to 70+ meters).

`radio.on()`
🔛 This turns the radio on, so your micro:bit can start sending.

`while True:`
🔁 This starts a forever loop — your micro:bit will keep doing what’s inside this loop again and again.

`radio.send('1')`
📨 This sends the message `'1' `over the radio.

💬 We’re not sending useful data — just something the other micro:bit can listen for.

`sleep(200)`
⏱ Wait for 200 milliseconds (0.2 seconds) before repeating.

This gives the micro:bit a short pause between each message.

## ✅ What the Code Does All Together
This code turns your micro:bit into a transmitter:

* It sends a radio message every 0.2 seconds

* Any nearby micro:bit (using the same group) can listen and measure how strong the signal is

* This helps you build a project like a signal strength meter (like the bars on your phone 📶)


## 2 Setting up the Receiver

```
from microbit import *
import radio
radio.config(group=1, power= 1)
radio.on()

while True:
    message = radio.receive()
    if message:
        display.show(message)
        sleep(200)
        display.clear()

```
## 🧠 Code Breakdown – Line by Line
`from microbit import *`
🎛 Loads everything we need to use the micro:bit’s features — like the display and buttons.

`import radio`
📡 Adds the radio tools so we can send and receive messages wirelessly.

`radio.config(group=1)`
🛠 Sets the radio group to 1.
Only micro:bits in the same group can talk to each other.

You must match the group with the transmitter!

`radio.on()`
🔛 Turns on the radio so the micro:bit can start listening.

`while True:`
🔁 Starts a forever loop.
This makes the micro:bit keep checking for messages all the time.

`message = radio.receive()`
👂 Listens for a message from the radio.

If it gets one, it stores it in the message variable.

`if message:`
✅ This means “if we got a message…”
Then we can do something with it.

`display.show(message)`
📺 Shows the received message (like a number or letter) on the LED screen.

`sleep(200)`
⏱ Waits for 200 milliseconds so the message stays on screen briefly.

`display.clear()`
🧼 Clears the LED screen to get ready for the next message.

## ✅ What This Code Does
Listens for messages from another micro:bit (transmitter)

* If a message is received:
    * It shows the message on the LED display
    * Waits briefly
    * Then clears the screen

💡 It’s great for simple text messages like numbers or letters!

## 💡 Try This!
Change the `sleep(200)` to a longer time `(e.g. 1000)` to show the message longer

Use the transmitter code to send messages like "A", "Hi!", or "1"

Display icons instead of letters using `display.show(Image.HEART)`

## 💡 Fun Experiments
Try these after it works:

🔋 Power the transmitter with batteries and walk around the room

👀 Watch how signal strength changes on the receiver

🛠 Change power=1 to power=7 and test the range

🎨 Add icons like display.show(Image.HEART) when sending



## 3 Let the players know that they are within range:
Displaying a message or image when th player is in range will help keep the player in range
```
from microbit import *
import radio

radio.config(group=1)
radio.on()

while True:
    message = radio.receive()
    if message:
        display.scroll("You rock!")

```



## 4 Let the players know when they are out of range
Informing a player that they are out of bounds will help them not proceed in the wrong direction while hunting

```
from microbit import *
import radio

radio.config(group=1)
radio.on()

timeout = 2000  # milliseconds to wait before considering "out of bounds"
last_received = running_time()  # track last time a message was received

while True:
    message = radio.receive()
    now = running_time()

    if message:
        display.scroll("You rock!")
        last_received = now  # reset timer when message received

    # If no message received for 'timeout' milliseconds, show "Out of bounds"
    elif now - last_received > timeout:
        display.scroll("Out of bounds")
        last_received = now  # reset to avoid scrolling repeatedly

    sleep(100)

```



## Challenge (Optional)
See what happens when you run this code for the receiver

```
from microbit import *
import radio
radio.config(group=1)
radio.on()
light = Image(5,5) # create an empty image

# function to map signal stength to LED brightness
def map(value, fromMin, fromMax, toMin, toMax):
    fromRange = fromMax - fromMin
    toRange = toMax - toMin
    valueScaled = float(value - fromMin) / float(fromRange)
    return toMin + (valueScaled * toRange)

while True:
    message = radio.receive_full()
    if message:
        signal = message[1]
        brightness = map(signal, -98, -44, 0, 9)
        light.fill(round(brightness))
        display.show(light)

```


## Reflection
* Did your program work well?
* Which part was easiest/hardest?
* What did you learn about variables, buttons, shake, and animations?
