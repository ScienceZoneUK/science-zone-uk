Before you start copying code, we need to make a folder!
Name it whatever you want but maybe "ClickingGame" so you know what it is.

Next download bg.png and move it into the folder you just made.

Now we can start copying some code!
We will be working from two .py files to pay attention to which file you need to copy the code into!!

In your Thonny copy the following:
```
import gui, time, random, pygame
```
And name this file "main.py"

Next copy this
```
import pygame, sys, time
from pygame.locals import *
```
And name this file "gui.py"
