By the end of this session, I will be able to:

- Define what a jumping platform game is.  
- Describe how gravity and movement work in Pygame.  
- Use code to build a simple **Doodle Jump** game.  
- Test and improve the game by adding fun new features.  

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What Is Doodle Jump?

üí¨ **Think & Discuss:**

- Have you ever played a game where you jump higher and higher?  
- What happens if your player falls off the screen?  
- What makes jumping games fun and exciting?  

üìå **Goal:**  
Keep your doodle jumping from one platform to another without falling!  
How high can you go? üåü

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Challenge üéÆ

We want to make a **Doodle Jump** game that:

- Starts when you run the program.  
- Uses **gravity** to make your doodle fall.  
- Makes your doodle **jump** when it lands on a platform.  
- Moves platforms down when your doodle goes high.  
- Ends the game when your doodle falls off the screen.  

‚úèÔ∏è **Write/Think:**  
What could make this game more fun or colorful?  
(Maybe clouds? Music? A rainbow background?)

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ How It Works üß†

ü™ú Your player (the doodle) is like a **rectangle** that can move left or right.  
üí® Gravity pulls the doodle down.  
üåà When the doodle touches a platform, it **bounces back up**!  
üìà The screen scrolls as you climb higher, and you earn **points** for each new platform.  

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Let's Build It! üß©

1. **Create a screen** for the game (like a window).  
2. **Add your player** (a yellow square).  
3. **Add some platforms** to jump on.  
4. **Make your player jump** when it hits a platform.  
5. **Add gravity** to make the player fall.  
6. **Keep score** as your doodle climbs higher!  

---

## Code Explianation
### Import and Start Pygame
```python
import pygame
import random
import sys
```
What does it do
- import brings in tools: pygame (game tools), random (for random positions), sys (for quitting nicely).
- pygame.init() turns on Pygame ‚Äî think of it as switching the game engine on.

### Create the game window
```python
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 400, 600
SCREEN = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("üåà Doodle Jump - Kids Edition")
```
What this does
- Makes a window 400√ó600 pixels where the game will appear.
- caption shows the game title at the top of the window.

### Colors and clock
```python
WHITE = (255,255,255)
BLUE = (100,150,255)
GREEN = (0,255,0)
BLACK = (0,0,0)
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
FPS = 60
```
What this does
- Defines colors using RGB (red, green, blue).
- Creates a clock to keep the game running at a steady speed (60 frames per second).

### The player (our doodle)
```python
player = pygame.Rect(WIDTH // 2 - 25, HEIGHT - 100, 50, 50)
player_speed_y = 0
gravity = 0.4
jump_power = -10
```
What this does
- player is a square (50√ó50) in the middle near the bottom.
- player_speed_y is how fast the player is moving up/down.
- gravity pulls the player down slowly each frame.
- jump_power is how strong a bounce is (negative = up).
### Platforms (the steps to jump on)
```python
platforms = [
    pygame.Rect(100, 500, 80, 10),
    pygame.Rect(200, 400, 80, 10),
    pygame.Rect(50, 300, 80, 10),
    pygame.Rect(250, 200, 80, 10)
]
```
What this does
- Makes four green platforms at different heights.
- Each platform is a rectangle that the player can land on.

### Score and font
```python
score = 0
font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)
```
What this does
- score keeps track of how many platforms the player passed.
- font decides how the score number looks on screen.
### Jump function
  ```python
  def jump():
    global player_speed_y
    player_speed_y = jump_power
  ```
  What this does
- A helper we could call to make the player jump. (In this program we set jump when colliding with a platform.)

### The game loop (the engine)
```python
running = True
while running:
    clock.tick(FPS)
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
```
What this does
- while running keeps the game repeating many times per second.
- clock.tick(FPS) makes each loop happen at a steady speed (60 times per second).
- The for event looks for actions like closing the window.

### Move left & right
```python
keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
    player.x -= 5
if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
    player.x += 5
```
What this does
- Reads keyboard keys. If left or right arrows are held, move the player horizontally.

### Wrap-around screen edges
```python
  if player.x < -50:
    player.x = WIDTH
elif player.x > WIDTH:
    player.x = -50
```
What this does
- If the player goes off the left side, it appears at the right (and vice versa). This makes the world wrap around.

### Gravity and move by vertical speed
```python
player_speed_y += gravity
player.y += player_speed_y
```
What this does
- Each frame we add gravity to vertical speed, then move the player by that speed.
- Positive player_speed_y ‚Üí moving down; negative ‚Üí moving up.
### Landing on platforms (bounce)
```python
for platform in platforms:
    if player.colliderect(platform) and player_speed_y > 0:
        player_speed_y = jump_power
```
What this does
- Checks if the player's rectangle is touching a platform and moving downward.
- If yes ‚Üí set vertical speed to jump_power so player bounces up.
### Scroll the world (when player gets high)
```python
if player.y < HEIGHT / 3:
player.y += abs(player_speed_y)
for platform in platforms:
platform.y += abs(player_speed_y)
if platform.y > HEIGHT:
            platforms.remove(platform)
            platforms.append(pygame.Rect(random.randint(0, WIDTH - 80), -10, 80, 10))
            score += 1
```
  What this does
- If the player moves above the top third of the screen, we move the player down a bit and push every platform down.
- Platforms that move off the bottom are removed and new ones are added at the top at random x-positions.
- Each time we create a new platform, we add 1 to score.
### Game over check
  ```python
    if player.y > HEIGHT:
    SCREEN.fill(BLACK)
    text = font.render("Game Over! Your Score: " + str(score), True, WHITE)
    SCREEN.blit(text, (30, HEIGHT // 2))
    pygame.display.flip()
    pygame.time.delay(2000)
    running = False
   ```
    What this does
- If the player falls below the bottom of the screen ‚Üí show "Game Over" and the score, pause 2 seconds, then stop the game.

### Draw everything (make it visible)
```python
SCREEN.fill(BLUE)
pygame.draw.rect(SCREEN, (255, 255, 0), player)
for platform in platforms:
pygame.draw.rect(SCREEN, GREEN, platform)
text = font.render("Score: " + str(score), True, BLACK)
SCREEN.blit(text, (10, 10))
pygame.display.flip()
```
   
What this does
- SCREEN.fill(BLUE) paints the sky.
- Draw the player (yellow) and platforms (green).
- Draw the score in the top-left.
- pygame.display.flip() updates the screen so the player sees the new frame.
