# Attention Code Ninjas 
So a GYM bro has been having a hard time tracking how much calories he should take and... he ain't really good at
that math stuff. So he needs you to help him make an app for him and his sister calculate how much calories they 
need to take so they don't fumble their look'smaxxing streak.

## Formula for Calorie Counter

### 1. Calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
This is the energy your body needs at rest. The Mifflin-St Jeor equation is commonly used. 
For Men: (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) – (5 × age in years) + 5
For Women: (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) – (5 × age in years) – 161 
### 2. Determine your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)
Multiply your BMR by an activity factor. 
Sedentary: BMR × 1.2 (little or no exercise)
Lightly Active: BMR × 1.375 (light exercise 1-3 days/week)
Moderately Active: BMR × 1.55 (moderate exercise 3-5 days/week)
Very Active: BMR × 1.725 (hard exercise 6-7 days/week)
Extra Active: BMR × 1.9 (very hard exercise or physical job) 
### 3. Adjust for Weight Goals
To lose weight: Aim for a deficit, like 500 calories less than your TDEE daily to lose about 1 pound (0.45 kg) per week. 
### Example Calculation (Male, 30 years, 175cm, 80kg, Moderately Active)
BMR: (10 × 80) + (6.25 × 175) – (5 × 30) + 5 = 800 + 1093.75 – 150 + 5 = 1748.75 calories.
TDEE: 1748.75 × 1.55 (moderately active) = ~2700 calories.
