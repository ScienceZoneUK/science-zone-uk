# Clicker Game

Orteil (the creator of cookie clicker) has gone bankrupt. You need to develop a new clicker game to recapture the public's interest and get Orteil out of banktruptcy.

## Step 1: Create a window

Use Python and Tkinter to create a window with a suitable title. Make it 800x600 pixels and make it so you can't resize it.

## Step 2: Score Label

Create a label to contain our current score. Decorate it how you want.

## Step 3: Create a Button

Create the first button. This should just simply increment the current score.

## Step 4: Buying autoclickers

Create a new button. This should decrease the score by some amount (a purchase) if possible. It should increment the number of autoclickers we have, and create an event which calls another "Autoclick" function.

This "Autoclick" function should increment the score, then create a new event to call itself every second.

## Step 5: Make the game harder

At the moment, it costs the same amount to buy an autoclicker every time. This makes it very easier to get insane scores. Make it so the cost of a new autoclicker increases as you buy more.

## Step 6: Repeat.

It's pretty boring at the moment with only autoclickers. Add new buttons in the same way to create more valuable autoclickers/buildings. Change their cost, how much they increment the score by, and how often they click.

## Step 7: Graphics

Add some images etc. to make the game more interesting.
