# Speed Away From Home
So speed has been on this world tour thing visiting some countries and he has been thinking of getting an app that would help him with choosing one. The GYM Bro from last week refered you to him and as  " sick coder guy" I guess that's his way of saying that you did a good job?
any ways Speed would like you to make an app that spawns out random flags for random countries that he could go to he would also like to know the price of the plane ticket for that trip from america also show random things or stream ideas he could do at the selected country 
You could call your app "iShow Countries"
