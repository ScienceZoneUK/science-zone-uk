# Sensei's
Go find projects online or use [chatgpt](chatgpt.com) to generate activities that teach coding concepts. We want things like variables, using functions, functions that return information, while loops, forloops, python lists, python dictionaries, modifying lists and dictionaries, global/local variables, fixing bugs and soo on. There are tons of resources online, checkout [rpi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/teach/), [another rpi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/python-coding-for-kids-beyond-the-basics/), [python for kids](https://kidspython.com/#/).
Use your imagination and create fun challenges with real-world contexts.

Please generate and save your activities using this template(copy-paste) and create a new folder with the name of your workshop in the sensei_activities folder

YOU MUST TEST your activites using thonny, make sure it works and that a child can read it.


# Python Workshop Activity Template

## Getting Started

### 1. Recommended Tools
- Install **[Thonny](https://thonny.org/)**: A beginner-friendly Python IDE to write and run your Python code.
- **[W3Schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)**: Use this as an additional resource to learn and explore Python concepts.

### 2. Preparing to Code
1. Open **Thonny**.
2. Create or open a folder named after yourself (e.g., `alex_python_workshop`).
3. Save **all your programs** in this folder:
   - File names should be in **lowercase**.
   - No **spaces** in file names. Use underscores (`_`) if needed.
   - File names should be **meaningful** (e.g., `greet_function.py`, not `file1.py`).

---

## Learning Objectives
- By the end of this activity, you will:
  1. Understand the concept of **[concept name]**.
  2. Write code to practice **[specific programming skill]**.
  3. Apply the learned concepts to solve challenges.

---

## Concept Explanation

### What is [Concept Name]?
- Briefly explain the concept in simple, beginner-friendly language.
- Example:
  **Functions** are blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks. You can define a function once and use it multiple times.

---

## Guided Activity

### Example Code
Save this code as `[example_file_name].py` in your folder:
```python
# Example code here
def example_function():
    print("Hello, World!")

example_function()
```

### Steps to Follow
1. Open **Thonny** and create a new file.
2. Copy and paste the code above into your file.
3. Save the file in your folder as `[example_file_name].py`.
4. Run the program to see the output.
5. Modify the program and experiment by changing parts of the code.

---

## Practice Activities

### Activity 1: [Activity Name]
Save this as `[activity1_file_name].py`.

- Add instructions for the activity here.
- Example:
  - Add another print statement to the function.
  - Modify the function to accept user input.

### Activity 2: [Activity Name]
Save this as `[activity2_file_name].py`.

- Add instructions for the second activity here.

---

## DIY Challenge

### Challenge 1: [Challenge Name]
Save this as `[challenge1_file_name].py`.

- Describe the challenge and provide hints or expected outcomes.
- Example:
  Write a function that takes a name as input and prints a personalized message.

### Advanced Challenge (Optional)
Save this as `[advanced_challenge_file_name].py`.

- Add an advanced challenge for students who want to go further.
- Example:
  Create a program with multiple functions that simulate a simple calculator.

---

## Summary
- **What did you learn?**
  - Summarize the key takeaways from the activity.
- **What‚Äôs next?**
  - Suggest related concepts or skills to explore next.
