# Activity 1 - Manual Searching

You are a master hacker trying to hack into the CIA to make LOADS of money. To get through their firewall and access their database, you need to enter the location of different objects in a randomly generated list.

Copy firewall_1.py into Thonny and run.

# Activity 2 - Automation

Well done! If you're reading this, you've managed to break into the CIA's database. Wouldn't it be easier if we could automate this process? You have decided to write a program to automatically find and enter the location of the objects in the list.

Read firewall_1.py so you get an understanding of what the CIA's code looks like, and how to interact with it. Then, when you're ready, write your automated bot in the section titled: "WRITE BOT HERE"

# Activity 3 - New System

Upon realising just how much money you've been making, the CIA has decided to upgrade their firewall. Instead of finding objects in a list, you now need to find the position of a number in a sorted list of numbers. They've also introduced a timer. If you don't manage to do it in time, the attempt fails. You need to break back in so you can continue to make LOADS of money.

Copy the code from firewall_2.py into a new file in Thonny and run. You will modify this later.

# Activity 4 - Automation 2

You miss the days where you had a bot to break into the database for you. In order to automate this system, you could use a similar algorithm to before, but this is slow, and the new timer makes this difficult. 

Research the binary search algorithm and try and implement it. Feel free to ask a sensei if you need help!
