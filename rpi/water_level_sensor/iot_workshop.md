[Source: Echo / BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cew2vxjgy7lo)

Flooding and river monitoring are serious problems. In the UK there are **90,000 km of rivers** ‚Äî and measuring their levels can save lives. Today, you‚Äôll learn how to measure water levels with sensors and build your own **IoT river network**.

Previously you used a rpi to serve a website that published river levels. The rpi does not have analog pins so we used a microbit to send the converted analog signal to the pi over serial communication. You used the flask framework to build a working website in html. You did all of this remotely over SSH.

What are the limitations of this setup?
- Scaleability
- Cost
- Setup

In this workshop we are going to look at The Internet of Things paradigm and how we can use it to improve our sensing setup

## Aims
- To scale up your rpi water level project
- To make a robust communication network
- To visualise the data online in a meaningful way

## Concepts
- IOT
- MQTT with Adafruit io
- SSH
- Command Line
- Inputs and Outputs
- Flask

## Tech
- Raspberry pi
- Pi pico
- Water level sensor
- Servo

## üîé Raspberry Pi vs Pico

### Raspberry Pi (microprocessor)
- Like a **mini PC**.  
- Runs Linux, has HDMI, USB, internet.  
- Can run Python, web servers, even Minecraft!  
- Great for **complex projects** but uses more power and costs ~¬£40+.

### Pico (microcontroller)
- Tiny board (~¬£8).  
- Runs **one program at a time**.  
- Has **analog pins** for sensors.  
- Built-in **Wi-Fi (Pico W/W2)**.  
- Perfect for **simple, low-power sensing tasks**.

üëâ **Key fact:**  
If you had to put sensors in hundreds of rivers, which would be cheaper and easier ‚Äî ¬£40 Raspberry Pis or ¬£8 Picos?  

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Microcontroller Blink Test (Hello World) 

Every Pico has a tiny LED onboard. Blinking it proves your code runs.

First things first we must test our pico is working.
- Connect the USB cable
- Open thonny
- Select the pico port (click bottom right)
- Press the **STOP** button to connect

Traditionally, we print 'Hello World' to the console; however, the microcontroller equivalent is to blink an LED as well.

Every board has an onboard led and that is a simple built in periphiral to access.

![blink_led](blink_led.png)

- Do you understand the code?  
- Why do we import board and digitalio?    
- What is a pin direction, and why is it set to output? 
- What is the variable, **led**, pointing to?

We can use a help method to get info about any python object:

help() ‚Äì Built-in method to provide helpful information

**Run this code using thonny**

```python
import board
help(board)
```

![rp board pins](board.png)

We can see the name of the GPIO on the left and the object dot notation on the right.

Run your code and then answer these questions:
- What is the object that stores the pin info?
- What pins are analog?
- Can you find the pin address for the onboard led?


**Run this code using thonny**

```python
import time, board, digitalio
led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.LED)
led.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT

while True:
    led.value = True
    time.sleep(0.5)
    led.value = False
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

üí° Did you know? ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù was first used as a test program in 1972 by Brian Kernighan. On microcontrollers, blinking an LED is the new Hello World.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Analog Sensor: Measuring Water

![Water Level Animation](https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/arduino/v2/Water-Level-Sensor-Working.gif)

Water level sensors measure how much water touches their tracks:
- **No water** ‚Üí low voltage  
- **Full water** ‚Üí higher voltage  

The Pico converts voltage into a number (0‚Äì65535). This is called **ADC** (Analog-to-Digital Conversion).  

![pico and water level sensor](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/umsk/en/latest/_images/Lesson_25_Water_Level_Sensor_Module_bb.png)


What connections do we need?
Is the analog pin in the illustration correct?

Look at this code, what is going on?
- Once you can read it correctly run it.
- Fix any errors

```python
import time, board, analogio
water_sensor = analogio.AnalogIn(board.GP26)

while True:
    print(water_sensor.value)  # Raw value 0‚Äì65535
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

üëâ Fact: Older Arduino boards only used 10 bits (0‚Äì1023). The Pico uses 16 bits (0‚Äì65535), which means it can measure with much finer detail.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Mapping: Turning Numbers into Meaning

Raw numbers are confusing. A value like `34567` doesn‚Äôt tell you much. But if we **map** it to centimeters, suddenly it makes sense:  
> 0 water = 0 cm  
> Full tank = 20 cm

Look at this code:
- Predict what will happen
- Why are captals used?

![analogue to digital water level](adc_level2.png)

An analogue value is non-sensical to most people. We need to provide some context for this.
We use a process called **mapping** where by we map one value to another, for example:
Take the number 10456. This is how many cornflakes make up one 750g packet.
What mathematical operation can I perform to map 1 cornflake to grams?

# üó∫Ô∏è Mapping Numbers with `map()`

When computers read from sensors or give us raw numbers, those numbers don‚Äôt always make sense.  
We use **mapping** to convert numbers from one scale to another.

---

## The `map()` Function

We‚Äôll copy the style from **Arduino/Processing** because it‚Äôs clear and easy to read.

```python
def map_value(value, start1, stop1, start2, stop2):
    """
    Remaps a number from one range to another.

    value  - the number to be mapped
    start1 - lower bound of the value's current range
    stop1  - upper bound of the value's current range
    start2 - lower bound of the value's target range
    stop2  - upper bound of the value's target range
    """
    return ( (value - start1) * (stop2 - start2) / (stop1 - start1) ) + start2
```

---

## Step-by-Step Explanation

Think of **two rulers**:  

- **Ruler A** = input numbers (like cornflakes count).  
- **Ruler B** = output numbers (like grams).  

We find out *where we are* on the first ruler, and then mark the **same spot** on the second ruler.  

---

## üéØ Visual Example

We know:  
- **0 flakes = 0 g**  
- **10,456 flakes = 750 g**  

So what about **2000 flakes**?

### Input ruler (flakes)

```
[0 flakes]----|--------------------------[10,456 flakes]
              ^
               2000 flakes (where we are)
```

### Output ruler (grams)

```
[0 g]---------|--------------------------[750 g]
              ^
              143 g (mapped result)
```

We‚Äôre about **20%** along the first ruler, so we‚Äôre also about **20%** along the second ruler.

---

## üìù Python Cornflakes Example

```python
CORNFLAKES_IN_PACKET = 10456
PACKET_WEIGHT_GRAMS = 750

#Add the map function

num_flakes = int(input("How many cornflakes do you have? "))

weight = map_value(num_flakes, 0, CORNFLAKES_IN_PACKET, 0, PACKET_WEIGHT_GRAMS)

print(f"{num_flakes} cornflakes weigh about {weight:.2f} grams")
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example Run

```
How many cornflakes do you have? 2000
2000 cornflakes weigh about 143.48 grams
```

---

## Why this is useful

- Works for **any ranges**:  
  - ADC 0‚Äì65535 ‚Üí water height 0‚Äì20 cm  
  - Joystick 0‚Äì1023 ‚Üí screen 0‚Äì799  
  - Slider 0‚Äì100 ‚Üí volume 0.0‚Äì1.0  

üëâ Mapping is just a **translator**: it takes numbers from one world and finds their meaning in another.  

Let's now use a map in a program that reads the analogue input.


```python
import time
import board
import analogio

# Analog input on GP26
water_sensor = analogio.AnalogIn(board.GP26)

# Calibration values ‚Äî measure these yourself
RAW_EMPTY = 12000   # ADC value when empty
RAW_FULL  = 52000   # ADC value when full
TANK_DEPTH_CM = 20  # height of your tank in cm

# Generic map function
def map_value(value, start1, stop1, start2, stop2):
    """
    Remaps a number from one range to another.
    """
    return ( (value - start1) * (stop2 - start2) / (stop1 - start1) ) + start2

def adc_to_level(raw):
    # Clamp so we don‚Äôt go outside expected range
    raw = max(min(raw, RAW_FULL), RAW_EMPTY)
    # Map ADC value (RAW_EMPTY..RAW_FULL) -> (0..TANK_DEPTH_CM)
    return map_value(raw, RAW_EMPTY, RAW_FULL, 0, TANK_DEPTH_CM)

while True:
    raw_value = water_sensor.value
    level_cm = adc_to_level(raw_value)
    print(f"ADC: {raw_value}  Level: {level_cm:.1f} cm")
    time.sleep(0.5)

```

üí° Analogy: Mapping is like using two rulers. If you‚Äôre 50% along ruler A, you‚Äôre also 50% along ruler B.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Pico + Wi-Fi Test

![pico wifi](pico_wifi.png)

The Pico W can connect to the internet! Let‚Äôs grab the real time:

```python
import wifi, socketpool, ssl, adafruit_requests

wifi.radio.connect("YOUR_WIFI", "YOUR_PASS")
print("IP:", wifi.radio.ipv4_address)

pool = socketpool.SocketPool(wifi.radio)
https = adafruit_requests.Session(pool, ssl.create_default_context())

r = https.get("http://worldtimeapi.org/api/ip")
print("Time:", r.json()["datetime"])
```

üëâ Protocol used here = **HTTP (web)**.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ IoT & MQTT

![mqtt](mqtt.png)  
[Source: Tekon](https://www.tekonelectronics.com/en/news/tekon-blog/understanding-mqtt-protocol/)

IoT = Internet of Things ‚Üí devices talk over the internet.  

If a microcontroller has Wi-Fi capabilities, it means that it can send messages containing data.  
Therefore, we must choose **how** we send our messages.  

There are many **messaging protocols** (rules for talking) depending on what we want to achieve:

- üì° **HTTP** ‚Äì the same system web browsers use.  
  Good for webpages, but heavier and slower for tiny devices.  

- üîî **WebSockets** ‚Äì a live two-way chat between computers.  
  Faster, but still more complex to set up.  

- ‚úâÔ∏è **MQTT** ‚Äì lightweight, simple, and designed for devices like the Raspberry Pi Pico.  
  Perfect when you have lots of small devices sending quick updates (like river levels).  

We choose **MQTT** because:  
- It uses **very little power and data**.  
- Devices don‚Äôt have to know about each other ‚Äî they only talk to the **broker**.  
- It‚Äôs easy to **scale up**: two Picos or two thousand, same system.  

That‚Äôs why MQTT is one of the most popular protocols for the **Internet of Things (IoT)**.  

---

![mqtt](mqtt.png)
[mqtt image](https://www.tekonelectronics.com/en/news/tekon-blog/understanding-mqtt-protocol/)

## The concept unpacked

Imagine:
- Lots of kids in a classroom (the **Picos**).  
- They all want to share info like ‚Äúmy sandwich is 80% eaten.‚Äù  
- Instead of shouting across the room, they pass notes to the **teacher** (the **broker**).  
- The teacher gives those notes only to kids who said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested in sandwich updates‚Äù (the **subscribers**).  

Result:  
- Everyone shares safely.  
- You only get info you actually want.  
- The teacher keeps things organised.  

---

## üõ† In reality

- Each **Pico W** has Wi-Fi.  
- It can connect to the internet and send/receive messages.  
- The system they use is called **MQTT** (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport).  

MQTT has 3 parts:  
1. **Publisher** ‚Üí sends a message (Pico sending `river1 = 12cm`).  
2. **Subscriber** ‚Üí listens for that message (a dashboard, or another Pico).  
3. **Broker** ‚Üí middleman server (like Adafruit IO) that delivers the message to the right place.  

---

## ‚úÖ Why are we using MQTT?  

Think of other ways devices could talk:  
- üì£ **Broadcast/shouting** ‚Üí everyone hears everything (wasteful, confusing).  
- üì¨ **Direct messages** ‚Üí you‚Äôd need every Pico to know where every other Pico lives (complicated).  

Instead, MQTT is like a **post office for messages**:  
- üîå **Lightweight** ‚Üí it uses very little power and data, perfect for tiny devices like Picos.  
- üìÆ **Organised** ‚Üí messages go through a broker, so Picos don‚Äôt need to know about each other.  
- üéØ **Selective** ‚Üí you only get the messages (topics) you subscribe to, so no overload.  
- üåç **Scalable** ‚Üí works for 2 Picos or 2,000, no big change in setup.  

That‚Äôs why MQTT is used in the **Internet of Things (IoT)** ‚Äî smart homes, sensors, wearables, and now your **UK river monitoring network**.  

---

## üéØ Example Flow

- Pico A publishes ‚Üí `water/river1 = 12cm`  
- Broker (Adafruit IO) holds it.  
- Your dashboard subscribes ‚Üí sees ‚Äú12cm‚Äù instantly.  
- RPI, pico, computer could also subscribe if it cares about river1.  

---

## üß© summary

- MQTT = **post office for tiny computers**.  
- Each Pico = a pen pal.  
- The broker = the post office.  
- Messages = letters.  
- Subscribe = signing up for the letters you actually want.  

That‚Äôs why your Picos can all be part of a **smart, efficient, and tidy network** üåä.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Toggle Pico LED from the Cloud

Let's take our blinking LED example and apply some IOT to it.
Open up a new program.

First import all your libraries. Notice all the libraries required for wifi and MQTT.

```python
import time, ssl, wifi, socketpool, board, digitalio
import adafruit_minimqtt.adafruit_minimqtt as MQTT
from adafruit_io.adafruit_io import IO_MQTT
```

Next we need to put our wifi and adafruit io config into variables.
Create your own Adafruit io account [click here](https://io.adafruit.com/).

![adafruit io](adafruitio.png)
Once you have an account you will need:
- copy Username to program
- copy Key to program
- create feed "toggle-led"

![adafruit io](feed.png)


Then:
Add this code next

```python

# ---------- CONFIG ----------
AIO_USERNAME = "YOUR_USERNAME"
AIO_KEY      = "YOUR_AIO_KEY"

WIFI_SSID    = "YOUR_WIFI"
WIFI_PASS    = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"

FEED_TOGGLE  = "toggle-led"    # feed your Adafruit IO Toggle writes to
# ---------------------------

led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.LED)
led.switch_to_output(value=False)

```

Now we connect to a router.

```python
# Wi-Fi
print("Connecting to Wi-Fi...")
wifi.radio.connect(WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASS)
print("Connected:", wifi.radio.ipv4_address)
```

Run your code to check for errors.   

Now we setup our connection to the internet and MQTT.    
Here Ive broken down the MQTT setup into familiar context:
Imagine:

- Wi-Fi radio = the road.
- Socket = the driveway that lets you connect to the road.
- MQTT = the postal service that knows how to handle letters.
- Broker (Adafruit IO) = the central post office.
- Username/Password = your ID card so the post office trusts you.
- SSL = sealing your letters in a locked envelope so nobody can snoop.
- Port 8883 = the specific mailbox slot for ‚Äúsecure MQTT letters‚Äù.

At the end, your Pico has a post office box set up ‚Äî ready to send and receive messages with other devices safely.

```python
# Socket + MQTT (TLS/SSL on 8883)
pool = socketpool.SocketPool(wifi.radio)
mqtt = MQTT.MQTT(
    broker="io.adafruit.com",
    username=AIO_USERNAME,
    password=AIO_KEY,
    socket_pool=pool,
    ssl_context=ssl.create_default_context()
)
io = IO_MQTT(mqtt)
```

Our picos are now ready to connect to the broker. First, we need to define some functions to handle the messages we will receive.

```python

# ---- callbacks ----

def handle_connect(client):
    print("Connected to Adafruit IO")
    print("Subscribing to:", FEED_TOGGLE)
    io.subscribe(FEED_TOGGLE)   # subscribe by feed key

def handle_message(client, topic, payload):
    text = str(payload).strip().lower()
    print(f"[MSG] {topic} -> '{text}'")
    # Topic from IO_MQTT is the feed key ('toggle-led'); no full topic check needed
    led.value = text in ("on", "1", "true", "high")
    print("LED =>", "ON" if led.value else "OFF")

io.on_connect = handle_connect
io.on_message = handle_message

io.connect()

```

The laast thing we need to do is create a loop that keeps our MQTT alive.

```python
# Simple publisher loop + MQTT processing
last_pub = 0
while True:
    io.loop()  # IMPORTANT: processes incoming MQTT messages

    #Setup for publishing
    now = time.monotonic()
    if now - last_pub >= PUBLISH_EVERY_SECONDS:
        last_pub = now
        #water_level = 123  # TODO: replace with your real sensor read
        #print("Publishing water level:", water_level)
        #io.publish(FEED_PUBLISH, water_level)

    time.sleep(0.05)

```


### Full program
```python
import time, ssl, wifi, socketpool, board, digitalio
import adafruit_minimqtt.adafruit_minimqtt as MQTT
from adafruit_io.adafruit_io import IO_MQTT


# ---------- CONFIG ----------
AIO_USERNAME = "cuvner"
AIO_KEY      = "add your own"

WIFI_SSID    = "J&C"
WIFI_PASS    = "Flat4141"

FEED_TOGGLE  = "toggle-led"    # feed your Adafruit IO Toggle writes to
PUBLISH_EVERY_SECONDS = 10     # Timer to control publishing messages
# ---------------------------

led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.LED)
led.switch_to_output(value=False)

# Wi-Fi
print("Connecting to Wi-Fi...")
wifi.radio.connect(WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASS)
print("Connected:", wifi.radio.ipv4_address)

# Socket + MQTT (TLS/SSL on 8883)
pool = socketpool.SocketPool(wifi.radio)
mqtt = MQTT.MQTT(
    broker="io.adafruit.com",
    username=AIO_USERNAME,
    password=AIO_KEY,
    socket_pool=pool,
    ssl_context=ssl.create_default_context()
)
io = IO_MQTT(mqtt)


# ---- callbacks ----

def handle_connect(client):
    print("Connected to Adafruit IO")
    print("Subscribing to:", FEED_TOGGLE)
    io.subscribe(FEED_TOGGLE)   # subscribe by feed key

def handle_message(client, topic, payload):
    text = str(payload).strip().lower()
    print(f"[MSG] {topic} -> '{text}'")
    # Topic from IO_MQTT is the feed key ('toggle-led'); no full topic check needed
    led.value = text in ("on", "1", "true", "high")
    print("LED =>", "ON" if led.value else "OFF")

io.on_connect = handle_connect
io.on_message = handle_message

io.connect()

# Simple publisher loop + MQTT processing
last_pub = 0
while True:
    io.loop()  # IMPORTANT: processes incoming MQTT messages

    #Setup for publishing
    now = time.monotonic()
    if now - last_pub >= PUBLISH_EVERY_SECONDS:
        last_pub = now
        #water_level = 123  # TODO: replace with your real sensor read
        #print("Publishing water level:", water_level)
        #io.publish(FEED_PUBLISH, water_level)

    time.sleep(0.05)

```
**SAVE YOUR WORK**

TANK_DEPTH_CM = 20  # height of your tank in cm

# Generic map function
def map_value(value, start1, stop1, start2, stop2):
    """
    Remaps a number from one range to another.
    """
    return ( (value - start1) * (stop2 - start2) / (stop1 - start1) ) + start2

def adc_to_level(raw):

    raw = max(min(raw, RAW_FULL), RAW_EMPTY)
    # Map ADC value (RAW_EMPTY..RAW_FULL) -> (0..TANK_DEPTH_CM)
    return map_value(raw, RAW_EMPTY, RAW_FULL, 0, TANK_DEPTH_CM)

while True:
    raw_value = water_sensor.value
    level_cm = adc_to_level(raw_value)
    print(f"ADC: {raw_value}  Level: {level_cm:.1f} cm")

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Reflection & Next Steps

- **Fact:** MQTT is used in smart homes, car sensors, even satellites.  
- **Question:** If you had 100 Picos in rivers, how would you keep track?  
- **Extension:** Use Flask on a Raspberry Pi to make your own live web dashboard.

# ‚úÖ Summary

- Raspberry Pi = full computer, Pico = tiny controller.  
- Sensors give analog values ‚Üí we **map** them to useful units.  
- Pico connects via **Wi-Fi**.  
- Devices use **MQTT** to send/receive messages.  
- You built an **IoT sensor network** for rivers!
